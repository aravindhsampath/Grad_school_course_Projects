Graduate School course Projects
===============================

Projects created while at Grad school at Clemson University

Each project has its own description and instructions in its README.


####License

I would always prefer to share my work to the world with MIT License. But there are a few projects where I have either worked upon the basic framework provided by the faculty, or the work is a product of a team project.
So I have added restrictive licenses for the few projects that are not entirely my work.
